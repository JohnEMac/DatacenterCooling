The Python, Go (GoLang), and C solutions of Quora's programming challenge: Datacenter Cooling

See: http://www.quora.com/challenges

To compare the performance of different implementations, we used 7x8 test case proposed in the description of the problem, see ./tests/in7x8_301716.txt file).

The development and optimization was done using Python.
The the Python code was rewritten to C with some optimizations.
C-code was compiled without and with "-O2" optimization.
Go-code was first produced by rewrittng 1-1 the C-code.
Then it was changed to make it more "idiomatic Go"

Short results:
    C is twice fast then Go
    C with O2 is twice fast then C compiled without optimizations.

Tested desktop system: Kubuntu 64bit, i5 750 @ 2.67GHz

C-code:            23 secs
C-code, -O2:       9.5 secs
Go-code, idomatic:
Go-code, C-like:

Tested laptop system: Uubuntu 32bit, i5 M 520 @ 2.40GHz

C-code:            21 secs
C-code, -O2:       12 secs
Go-code, idomatic: 1m 32secs
Go-code, C-like:   42 secs
